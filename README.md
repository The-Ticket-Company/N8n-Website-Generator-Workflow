# N8n Website Generator Workflow 🌐⚡

This repository contains an **automation workflow** built in [n8n](https://n8n.io/) that generates and deploys basic websites dynamically.  
It was designed as a **no-code/low-code experiment** to showcase how automation + AI can power rapid prototyping.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamically creates website pages from structured prompts.
- Uses AI content generation (OpenAI integration).
- Auto-deploys via GitHub Pages / Netlify.
- Scalable workflow you can customize for different industries (e.g. landing pages for startups, personal portfolios, or MVPs).
